# PARTITIONING A SPLIT GRAPH INTO INDUCED SUBGRAPHS ISOMORPHIC TO THE PATH OF ORDER 3

This was my diploma. Yep. Interesting stuff can be found there, or may be not.

Mostly I would like to show how it works and what does it do. 

We have 5 situation when our bipartite graph can be divided by specific sub graphs. 

Visual stuff is done in javaSwing becouse of graphstream libraly (mostly becouse it doesn't wanna work on javaFX). 

Don't forget to add something right here.
