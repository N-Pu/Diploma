# PARTITIONING A SPLIT GRAPH INTO INDUCED SUBGRAPHS ISOMORPHIC TO THE PATH OF ORDER 3

This was my diploma. Yep. Interesting stuff can be found there, or may be not.

Mostly I would like to show how it works and what does it do. 

We have 5 situation when our bipartite graph can be divided by specific sub graphs. 

Visual stuff is done in javaSwing becouse of graphstream libraly (mostly becouse it doesn't wanna work on javaFX).

Here it is. Yes. Very clean and...comfy. Oh no-nom that's not it. Anyway. In this programm we can do 6 things:

1. Click on the first button. Wow.
2. Click on the second Section button. Oh my god...
3. Smash the third one. I'm getting used to thus.
4. ...4th one.
5. 5th.
6. Clean the area.

Yep. That's what it does. Also there are some notes in console and other things but that's not important.
